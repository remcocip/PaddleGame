## **Background:** 
Author: Remco (remco.cip@gmail.com)
* This is my final project for the CS106A course, provided for free by Stanford Code in Place: https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/ 
* During this course I had so much fun and learned a lot about Python programming.

## **INSTALLATION:** 
* First, make sure python3 is installed.
* Then get the graphics.py library, included in this repository. (Copied from Stanford and changed.)
* Install the pillow package: "python -m pip install pillow"

### **How do I play?**
* Start the game by running "python paddle_game.py"
* The amount of rounds needs to be chosen
* To move player one: Left and right arrow keys
* To move player two: Mouse positioned relative to the paddle
